# Snake Game

This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game using Python's Turtle module.

## How to Play
- Use the W, A, S, and D keys to control the snake's movement (up, left, down, right).
- Eat the red food to grow the snake and earn points.
- Avoid colliding with the walls or the snake's own body.
- The game ends when the snake collides with the walls or itself.
